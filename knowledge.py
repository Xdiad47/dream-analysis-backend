    an emotion, person, or situation the dreamer is trying to avoid. Common meanings include:
    - Avoiding a difficult conversation or decision
    - Running from responsibility or fear
    - Escaping unwanted emotions (anxiety, guilt, shame)
    Therapeutic insight: The solution isn't to run faster, but to turn around and confront what's chasing you.
    This dream often appears during periods of high stress or when avoiding important life decisions.
